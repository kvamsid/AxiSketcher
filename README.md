[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-blue)](https://kvamsid.github.io/AxiSketcher/)

## 📌 Overview

AxiSketcher is an innovative interactive visualization tool that allows users to define **nonlinear axis mappings** through intuitive sketching. It bridges the gap between user domain knowledge and complex multidimensional datasets, enabling personalized data exploration and analysis.

## ✨ Features

- **Sketch-Based Axis Mapping** – Draw lines on visualizations to redefine axes dynamically.
- **Scatter Plot Interaction** – Select points, draw polylines, and freeform curves to create new data representations.
- **Axis Rainbow Visualization** – A ThemeRiver-style visual aid for attribute evolution.
- **Customizable Views** – List, Table, Parallel Coordinates, Aster Plot, and Radar Plot.
- **Attribute Manipulation** – Modify values dynamically through interactive UI elements.
- **Brushing & Linking** – Seamless interaction between Main View and Detail View.

## 📊 Data Used

### Car Dataset
- Attributes: Retail Price, Cylinder Capacity, Horsepower, City/Highway Mileage, Wheel Drive, etc.
- Purpose: Explore user preferences and nonlinear relationships.

### Food Dataset
- Attributes: Nutritional properties like Fiber, Iron, Carbohydrates, Magnesium, etc.
- Purpose: Discover dietary trends and personalized insights.

## 🖥️ Interface Overview

### 1️⃣ **Interaction Dashboard**
- **Search Functionality** – Dynamically highlight and filter data points.
- **Draw & Explore** – Create custom nonlinear axes.
- **Axis Switch** – Toggle between default and user-defined axes.
- **Glyph Representation** – Adjust glyph sizes and visibility.

### 2️⃣ **Main View**
